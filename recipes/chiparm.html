            <p>If you haven't made Chicken Parmesan in an air fryer yet, consider this your invitation to get started. This recipe yields crispy, juicy chicken and ultra-melty cheese, which pairs beautifully with the acidity of tomato sauce. Before the final cook in the air fryer, be sure to line the inside of the basket with aluminum foil, and coat the foil with cooking spray to prevent sticking. As for serving? You can pair the chicken with a salad, such as a classic Caesar, or go for garlicky broccoli, Broccolini, or broccoli rabe.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a small saucepan over medium. Add garlic and crushed red pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic begins to sizzle, about 30 seconds. Add tomato puree, 2 teaspoons of the basil, 1 teaspoon of the parsley, 1/2 teaspoon of the oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt; stir to combine. Bring to a simmer over medium; simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside.</li>
           <li>Preheat an air fryer to 360°F for 5 minutes. Sprinkle chicken evenly with black pepper and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt. Place flour in a shallow dish. Whisk together beaten egg and water in a separate shallow dish until combined. Stir together panko, 1/3 cup of the Parmesan, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon basil, 1 teaspoon parsley, and 1 teaspoon oregano in a third shallow dish. Working with 1 chicken piece at a time, dredge chicken in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in egg wash, letting excess drip off. Dredge in panko mixture, pressing to coat all sides of chicken. Place breaded chicken on a plate.</li> 
            <li>Coat bottom of air fryer basket with cooking spray. Arrange chicken about 1 inch apart in basket. Cook for 8 minutes. Gently flip chicken; cook until chicken is golden brown on both sides, about 8 minutes. Remove chicken from basket. Increase air fryer temperature to 400°F. Line basket with aluminum foil, and coat foil with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Top chicken evenly with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan. Return chicken to foil-lined basket; cook at 400°F until cheese is completely melted and browned and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165°F, 5 to 10 minutes. Garnish chicken with additional parsley, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
